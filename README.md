EVIL CORP.Ⓡ BLUESIM™ BSOD SCREENSAVER DISTRIBUTION & INSTALLATION
Version ∞.2 (© 2015–2024 Theodore “Ted” Carrigan-Broda 💯) 

INSTALLATION OVERVIEW: This repository contains files for installing “blue screen of death” reboot loop simulator screensavers on Windows systems (Windows 8 and higher). The “Compiled_Installers” subdirectory contains .EXE installers; the “Compiled_Screensavers” subdirectory contains .SCR screensaver packages. See below to select the appropriate software product for your system.

SCREENSAVER PACKAGES: The .SCR files will launch the screensaver directly; it will not install the screensaver in your default installation directory (C:\Windows\System\) for use in Windows themes. You may download the .SCR files to a local path and create shortcuts or program references (e.g., BAT files) to launch the .SCR files with user input (e.g., create a “Google Chrome” desktop shortcut that instead references the .SCR file path).

SCREENSAVER INSTALLERS: The .EXE installers will install the screensavers to the Windows system for all users. This will allow the user to select the screensaver for Windows themes under Settings → Personalization → Lock screen → Screen Saver → Screen Saver Settings. Select the installed screensaver from the drop-down menu, click the “Settings…” button to personalize the screensaver settings, then click “OK”. You may also select the “Preview” button to preview the installed screensaver before selecting it as your default screensaver.

To install, launch the installer wizard by double-clicking on the downloaded file. After accepting the user agreement, click “Next.” In the next screen, browse to the default screensaver installation directory (usually C:\Windows\System) with the “Browse…” button, then click “Install” and “Next.” Click “Finish” to exit the wizard. The Screen Saver Settings window may load automatically. You may also manually access the window using the instructions above.

DISPLAY OPTIMIZATION: There are separate screensaver packages and installers optimized for different display resolutions. Files containing “768” in the name are optimized for 1366 × 768 displays/monitors. Files containing “1080” in the name are optimized for 1920 × 1080 (full HD) displays/monitors.

MULTIMEDIA FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS: Most of the screensaver packages and installers use MPEG-based content and should have native support on modern Windows systems. However, these MPEG-based screensavers are only optimized for 1920 × 1080 displays. The screensavers will still render on 1366 × 768 displays, but the multimedia may be distorted, blurry, slow, or pixelated.

The default installers contain embedded FFmpeg libraries for optimized rendering on Windows systems. This is recommended for most users. Basic installers without embedded FFmpeg libraries contain “basic” in the filename.

Additional screensaver packages and installers (containing “Flash” in the filenames) use Adobe Flash–based SWF animation content. However, these software products require the legacy Adobe Flash Player to run on Windows systems. This program is freely available for download from Adobe, but it is no longer updated or supported by the developer. These SWF-based screensavers include screensavers optimized for 1366 × 768 displays/monitors.
